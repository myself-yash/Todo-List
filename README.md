# Todo-List

Welcome to my Spring Boot Todo-List project! This project showcases my skills in Java, Spring, Spring Boot, JPA, Spring Security, and REST API development. It's a fully functional Todo-List application that allows users to manage their tasks seamlessly.

Key Features:

Java and Spring Boot: I implemented the backend of this project using Java and Spring Boot, harnessing the power of the Spring framework to create a robust and efficient application.

JPA (Java Persistence API): To interact with the database, I used JPA, which provides an elegant way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

Spring Security: Security is a top priority, so I integrated Spring Security to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their tasks.

RESTful API: The project exposes a RESTful API that enables users to perform CRUD operations on their todo items. It follows best practices for designing RESTful endpoints.

MySQL Database: I chose MySQL as the database system to store and manage todo items. MySQL is reliable and widely used in the industry.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): I developed this project using IntelliJ IDEA, a powerful IDE that enhances productivity and code quality.

Postman Testing: To ensure the functionality of the REST API, I extensively tested it using Postman, a popular tool for API testing.

Usage:

You can clone this repository and run the project locally using Spring Boot. Make sure to set up your MySQL database configuration and adjust the application.properties file to match your database settings.
